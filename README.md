# Parch-and-Posey
I have leveraged the extensive database of a company known as Parch and Posey, employing a wide array of SQL queries and functions to extract invaluable insights for our end users. Through the strategic application of functions like DATEPART, JOINs, HAVING, CASE, and an assortment of others, I have harnessed the power of data to unlock essential information. These insights range from identifying the top performer within the company, to determining the most frequently utilized communication channel, and aggregating the sum of various crucial attributes. By harnessing the potential of SQL and data manipulation, we have empowered our organization with the knowledge necessary to make informed decisions and drive success in our endeavors.
